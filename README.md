# DJI Mobile SDK for Android

## What Is This?

The DJI Mobile SDK enables you to automate your DJI Product. You can control flight, and many subsystems of the product including the camera and gimbal. Using the Mobile SDK, create a customized mobile app to unlock the full potential of your DJI aerial platform.

## Different CPU Architectures Support

For developers who want to support mobile devices with different CPU architectures accurately, please refer to the **SO Support Libraries** folder.

## Package Name Replace Script

Since Android SDK 3.3 has changed or deprecated some package names or class names, we provide an executable JAR file, which contains scripts for you to replace with latest names automatically. Please refer to [this link](./Executable JAR/README.md) for more details.

## Running the SDK Sample Code

Developers can [run the sample application](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html) to immediately run code and see how the DJI Mobile SDK can be used.

One of DJI's aircraft or handheld cameras will be required to run the sample application.
