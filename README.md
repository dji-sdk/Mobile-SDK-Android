# DJI Mobile SDK for Android Latest Version 4.16

## What Is This?

The DJI Mobile SDK enables you to automate your DJI Product. You can control flight, and many subsystems of the product including the camera and gimbal. Using the Mobile SDK, create a customized mobile app to unlock the full potential of your DJI aerial platform.

## Integration

Declare dependency via Maven:

~~~xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.dji</groupId>
    <artifactId>dji-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>4.16</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.dji</groupId>
    <artifactId>dji-sdk-provided</artifactId>
    <version>4.16</version>
</dependency>
~~~

or Gradle:

~~~groovy
compile 'com.dji:dji-sdk:4.16'
provided 'com.dji:dji-sdk-provided:4.16'
~~~

For further detail on how to integrate the DJI Android SDK into your Android Studio project, please check the [Integrate SDK into Application](http://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/application-development-workflow/workflow-integrate.html#import-maven-dependency) tutorial.

## Running the SDK Sample Code

Developers can [run the sample application](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html#android-sample-app) to immediately run code and see how the DJI Mobile SDK can be used.

One of DJI's aircraft or handheld cameras will be required to run the sample application.

## Learn More about DJI Products and the Mobile SDK

Please visit [DJI Mobile SDK Documentation](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/index.html) for more details.

## DJI Mobile UX SDK

DJI Mobile UX SDK is a suite of product agnostic UI objects that fast tracks the development of iOS applications using the DJI Mobile SDK. For more details, please check [here](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-UXSDK-Android).

## Device Health Information Json File

You can find the **hms.json** and **`hms_match_sdkerror.json`** files in this repo's root folder.

It contains error code and detailed description for device components. Only supported by some components of Matrice 300 RTK and Zenmuse H20 series.

It is recommended to use device health information to replace old diagnostics for flight controller and RTK. There will be a few duplicated component error for gimbal, battery, perception module on Matrice 300 RTK.

Please refer to the table below for duplicated error:

| DJIDiagnosticsError | Enum Value | AlarmId |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| `BATTERY_DISCHARGE_OVER_CURRENT`  | 3001 | 0x110B0001|
| `BATTERY_DISCHARGE_OVER_HEAT` | 3002  | 0x110B0002 |
| `BATTERY_LOW_TEMPERATURE` | 3003  | 0x110B0003 |
| `BATTERY_CELL_BROKEN` | 3004 | 0x110B0006 |
| `GIMBAL_CONNECT_TO_FC_ERROR` | 2005 | 0x1D030001 |
| `GIMBAL_GYROSCOPE_ERROR` | 2001 | 0x1D040002 |
| `GIMBAL_PITCH_ERROR` | 2002 | 0x1D040004 |
| `GIMBAL_ROLL_ERROR` | 2003 | 0x1D040003 |
| `GIMBAL_YAW_ERROR` | 2004 | 0x1D040005 |


## ProGuard

If you're planning on optimizing your app with [ProGuard](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html), you can add the following rules to your app's `proguard.cfg` file:

- For **AAR** file, please use the following rule:

~~~
"-libraryjars ./PATH_TO_THIS_FILE/dji_android_sdk.aar"
~~~

- For **API Library** folder, please use the rules in [proguard-project](<https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-Android/blob/master/Sample Code/app/proguard-rules.pro>) file. 

> **Note**: There are two types of DJI Android SDK: **AAR** and **API Library folder**, you can download them from DJI Developer Website: <http://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/downloads/>.

## SDK Keys

SDK Keys can be used as an alternative interface to access the product.

A detailed introduction for SDK Keys is [here](./docs/README-KeyedInterface.md).

## Missions Refactor

Missions are an important part of the SDK as they allow developers to automate DJI's products using a simple, high level interface. In 4.0, missions are being refactored to be more robust and easier to manage.

A detailed introduction for missions is [here](./docs/README-Mission.md).
