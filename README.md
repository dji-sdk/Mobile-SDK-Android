# DJI Mobile SDK for Android

## What Is This?

The DJI Mobile SDK enables you to automate your DJI Product. You can control flight, and many subsystems of the product including the camera and gimbal. Using the Mobile SDK, create a customized mobile app to unlock the full potential of your DJI aerial platform.

## Running the SDK Sample Code

Developers can [run the sample application](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html) to immediately run code and see how the DJI Mobile SDK can be used.

One of DJI's aircraft or handheld cameras will be required to run the sample application.

## Development Workflow 

From registering as a developer, to deploying an application, the following will take you through the full Mobile SDK Application development process:

## Learn More about DJI Products and the Mobile SDK

Please visit [DJI Mobile SDK Documentation](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/index.html) for more details.

## DJI Mobile UI Library

DJI Mobile UILibrary is a suite of product agnostic UI objects that fast tracks the development of iOS applications using the DJI Mobile SDK. For more details, please check [here](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-UILibrary-Android).

## SDK Keys

SDK Keys can be used as an alternative interface to access the product.

A detailed introduction for SDK Keys is [here](./docs/README-KeyedInterface.md).

## Missions Refactor

Missions are an important part of the SDK as they allow developers to automate DJI's products using a simple, high level interface. In 4.0, missions are being refactored to be more robust and easier to manage.

A detailed introduction for missions is [here](./docs/README-Mission.md).
